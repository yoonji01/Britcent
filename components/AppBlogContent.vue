      <p>Air travel can be stressful at the best of times but discovering that you have misplaced your BRP card, or passport is a situation that all international travelers and Bright World guardianship students alike seek to avoid. Advice is of course offered by all good airlines and Travel Agents to check for these all-important documents before you commence your journey but unfortunately, despite these guidelines and our best efforts, the worst can still happen.</p>
      <p>At Bright World, we know this only too well, with a record 8 such occurrences taking place during the recent Christmas departure and January arrival, forcing us to work against the clock to avoid missed flights and stranded students. These two major events in the guardianship calendar require careful preparation and close contact with overseas parents. UK Boarding Schools close during the Christmas period and most students fly home to be with their families, so it is vital we ensure our students reach their chosen airport on time and with their travel documents in tow.</p>
      <p> <em>“We ask our drivers to allow students 3 hours at the airport to check in plus an additional 30 minutes driving time incase there is traffic or lost items, such as passports, UM or BRP documentation.”</em> Leanne Poole, Bright World Travel Manager.</p>
